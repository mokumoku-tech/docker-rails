# Rails on Docker example and tutorial

[→日本語🇯🇵](./README.ja.md)

This is an example and tutorial to build and run your Rails app on Docker.

## For Windows users

Replace `` `pwd` `` with `%CD%` in your Command Prompt or PowerShell.

Otherwise you would see an error like following:

> docker: Error response from daemon: create \`pwd\`/app: “`pwd`/app” includes invalid characters for a local volume name, only “[a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9_.-]” are allowed. If you intended to pass a host directory, use absolute path.

# Preparation

You need followings:

- Docker installed

# Try this example

Clone this repository.

```console
$ git clone git@github.com:ginpei/docker-rails-example.git
$ cd docker-rails-example/
```

Up Docker container.

```console
$ docker-compose up
```

Open another console and run this to initialize database.

```console
$ cd docker-rails-example/
$ docker-compose exec rails rake db:create db:migrate db:seed
```

Open in browser.

- [`http://localhost:3000/`](http://localhost:3000/)

To stop, in the console where `docker-compose` is running, hit `Ctrl + C` and wait.

```console
Gracefully stopping... (press Ctrl+C again to force)
Stopping docker-rails-example_rails_1   ... done
Stopping docker-rails-example_db_1      ... done

$
```

# Create a new Rails app

1. Prepare a directory for the app
2. Run `rails new` in Docker
3. Describe a Docker image for your app where gems are installed
4. Database configuration
5. Prepare Docker component file with database specification
6. Ignore database files
7. Up them
8. Stop them (once)
9. Open another console
10. Initialize database
11. Open in browser

We name the app "my-great-app".
Please do not forget replace this with your great app's name.

Directory structure would be this:

```
my-great-app/
+ app/
|  - (Rails app files like `config.ru`)
+ db/
|  - (Database files)
+ .gitignore
+ docker-compose.yml
+ Dockerfile
+ README.md
```

## Prepare a directory for the app

```console
$ mkdir my-great-app
$ cd my-great-app
```

We will be working here.

## Run `rails new` in Docker

This step can be broken down into smaller steps.

1. Start docker container
2. `rails new`
3. Create empty `Gemfile.lock`
4. Expose created files to your host computer
5. Exit from docker container

First of all, run a docker container:

```console
$ mkdir app
$ docker run --rm -ti -v `pwd`/app:/app rails:5.0.1 bash
```

`5.0.1` is a tag of the image, as Rails version. Find available tags here:

- [library/rails - Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/library/rails/tags/)

This should take long time when you try at the first time since Docker downloads a Docker image of Rails. From next time, it would up soon.

Then you'll see you are in docker container. You may want to check the rails version:

```console
root@b4227fbcb3b1:/# rails --version
Rails 5.0.1
root@b4227fbcb3b1:/#
```

Note that, inside a Docker container, you cannot use `Ctrl-P`. This is a special key for Docker.

In the container, run `rails new` with some options.

```console
root@b4227fbcb3b1:/# rails new my-great-app --skip-bundle --database=mysql
      create
      create  README.md
      create  Rakefile
      create  config.ru
...
      create  vendor/assets/stylesheets
      create  vendor/assets/stylesheets/.keep
      remove  config/initializers/cors.rb
root@b4227fbcb3b1:/#
```

`--skip-bundle` option, as you read, skips `bundle install`.
The installation will happen later so you don't do that for now.

`--database` option is up to you.
In this tutorial, we chose MySQL as the DBMS for our Rails app.

Since we skipped `bundle install`, we need empty lock file for after operation.

```console
$ touch /my-great-app/Gemfile.lock
```

To expose result to you host computer, move the generated files to the shared volume. And exit.

```console
root@b4227fbcb3b1:/# cp -rT my-great-app/* /app
root@b4227fbcb3b1:/# exit
```

`-T` option of `cp` is to copy dot files (`.gitignore`).

(The reason we didn't generate files directly in `/app` is Rails generates files using the directory name with template. Please let me know if you know the way to do that directly.)

Check the files exist on your computer outside Docker container.

```console
$ ls -a app/
.   .gitignore  Gemfile.lock  Rakefile  bin     config.ru  lib  public  tmp
..  Gemfile     README.md     app       config  db         log  test    vendor
```

## Describe an image for your app where gems are installed

Create a new file named `Dockerfile`, which has no extension:

```dockerfile
FROM rails:5.0.1

RUN mkdir /app
WORKDIR /app

COPY ./app/Gemfile /app/Gemfile
COPY ./app/Gemfile.lock /app/Gemfile.lock

RUN bundle install
CMD rm /app/tmp/pids/server.pid ; rails s
```

## Database configuration

Although we haven't got database ready yet, modify rails configuration a little.

Change `host: localhost` to `host: db` in `app/config/database.yml`:

```yml
default: &default
  adapter: mysql2
  encoding: utf8
  pool: 5
  username: root
  password:
  host: db
```

This `db` will be used in the next step as a service name in `docker-compose.yml`.

## Prepare Docker component file with database specification

Create a new file named `docker-compose.yml` as following:

```yml
version: "3"

services:

  rails:
    build: ./
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    volumes:
      - ./app:/app
    depends_on:
      - db

  db:
    image: mysql
    volumes:
      - ./db:/var/lib/mysql
    environment:
      MYSQL_ALLOW_EMPTY_PASSWORD: "true"
```

This prepares a database for root user without password.
It's unsafe in some cases but you know this is only for development.

## Ignore database files

If you use git, create `.gitignore`  and ignore database files:

```
/db/
```

## Up them

```console
$ docker-compose up
```

This takes longer time for the first time too.

First, it builds an image from your `Dockerfile` for your project. This process includes `bundle install`.

Second, after starting, MySQL creates database files in `db`.

Take your time until your console gets calm down.

## Stop them (once)

Try to stop the containers by holding `Ctrl-C` in the console. Closing process may take time. Be patient.

```console
Gracefully stopping... (press Ctrl+C again to force)
Stopping docker-rails-example_rails_1   ... done
Stopping docker-rails-example_db_1      ... done

$
```

If you get how to up and end it, up again and move on to the next.

## Open another console

Keep the Docker containers running.

While they are running, you need to open a new console to work.

## Initialize database

In the 2nd console just you opened, type following line to create database while running `docker-compose up` in the 1st one.

```console
$ docker-compose exec rails rake db:create
Created database 'my-great-app_development'
Created database 'my-great-app_test'
```

## Open in browser

Open [`http://localhost:3000/`](http://localhost:3000/) and look at what you have done! Yay! You’re on Rails!

![Welcome screen from Rails](doc/you-are-on-rails.png)

# Up your project from the next time

Now it's simple.

```console
$ docker-compose up
```

And open [`http://localhost:3000/`](http://localhost:3000/).

You may need the 2nd console to run commands like `rails g scaffold`.

# Update your project

## General idea

You may want to run `rails`, `rake` or any other commands. For those cases, the most basic idea is running `docker-compose exec rails xxx`.

Let's say you want to `echo` here. You would use this:

```console
$ docker-compose exec rails echo Hello from Docker container!
```

Please remember you have to type this command into your 2nd console, next the 1st one where your `docker-compose up` is running.

## When you want to generate a scaffold

```console
$ docker-compose exec rails rails g scaffold post title:string body:text
      invoke  active_record
      create    db/migrate/20180806212720_create_posts.rb
      create    /models/post.rb
...
      create      /assets/stylesheets/posts.scss
      invoke  scss
      create    /assets/stylesheets/scaffolds.scss
```

Don't forget migration! (See next chapter.)

## When you generated a new migration

```console
$ docker-compose exec rails rake db:migrate
== 20180806212720 CreatePosts: migrating ======================================
-- create_table(:posts)
   -> 0.0766s
== 20180806212720 CreatePosts: migrated (0.0769s) =============================
```

## When you want to run test

```console
$ docker-compose exec rails rake test
Run options: --seed 52703

# Running:

.......

Finished in 1.302024s, 5.3762 runs/s, 6.9123 assertions/s.
7 runs, 9 assertions, 0 failures, 0 errors, 0 skips
```

## When you added new gems

When you update `Gemfile`, you used to run `bundle install`.

With Docker, you need to rebuild your image instead. This process includes `bundle install` and updates `Gemfile.lock`.

To rebuild, give `--force-recreate` option.

```console
$ docker-compose.exe up --build
```

Otherwise you would see an error like this (you could miss it because the log is too long to read):

```
rails_1  | /usr/local/lib/ruby/gems/2.3.0/gems/bundler-1.13.7/lib/bundler/resolver.rb:366:in `block in verify_gemfile_dependencies_are_found!': Could not find gem 'carrierwave' in any of the gem sources listed in your Gemfile or available on this machine. (Bundler::GemNotFound)
rails_1  |      from /usr/local/lib/ruby/gems/2.3.0/gems/bundler-1.13.7/lib/bundler/resolver.rb:341:in `each'
...
rails_1  |      from /usr/local/bundle/bin/rails:15:in `<main>'
```

# Join somebody's project

These steps should be described in the project's README documentation.

1. Clone the repository
2. Up Docker containers
3. Initialize database
4. Start your job

## Clone the repository

```console
$ git clone ...
$ cd xxx
```

## Up Docker containers

```console
$ docker-compose up
```

Hold `Ctrl-C` to stop.

## Initialize database

Open another console and run:

```console
$ docker-compose exec rails rake db:create db:migrate db:seed
```

## Start your job

Open [`http://localhost:3000/`](http://localhost:3000/) (and another console maybe) and start your job.

Let's rock!
